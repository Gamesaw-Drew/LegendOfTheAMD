      <h3>LEGEND OF THE AMD PROGRESS REPORT #1<br><small>By Drew posted April 26, 2017</small>
      </h3>
<p>Hello! Welcome to the first progress report for Legend of the AMD! There will be more of these in the future to come.</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing I want to talk about is the brand new launcher! Incase you were unaware, the other day I had released a brand new launcher! The new launcher properly automatically updates the game when an update is available, and will only update the needed files. Currently, files on the website are not compressed at all, so it may take a little while to download, but it only has to fully download the game one time, then when an update is out, it will download those files.</p><p><br></p><p>The second thing I want to talk about is remodels. As you may know, the current models are, well, trash. I never liked the models very much as they were very blocky and overall poorly done. I have started to remodel some models, also keeping optimization in mind. For the optimization, most models will have multiple LODs, meaning the farther away you are, the lower the detail will be, which will help FPS. Another model related upgrade is animations. Recently, I have redone the Walking animation, done slight tweaks to the idle animation, and added an original animation to be used during the first cutscene, when Chris finds the computer in the shop.</p>

        </section>
        <p>The last big thing I am going to talk about is Unity. Currently, the latest published build was using a slightly older Unity 5.6 Beta, however, I have recently started porting it to the new Unity 2017 Beta 1. The advantages for doing this so early are: It will take less time to port when the final build of Unity 2017 comes out, and to be able to take advantage of newer features as they come out. The disadvantages are currently, Unity 2017 has quite a lot of changes, many of which have broken aspects of the game. At this moment of time, all multiplayer aspects and code have been removed due to this update, but I plan to rewrite the multiplayer to be actually functional. When Unity 5.6 fully released, some new changes were made that allow me to easily greatly upgrade the graphics effects.</p>

<p>The next game update will have all of these changes, and much more. I can't wait to see how it comes out.</p>
